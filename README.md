# lowlevelprogramming-university

## What is it?

This is my multi-years study experience to be low-level programmer.
I've working as low-level programmer for 10 years.
* 80x86 Assembly programming
* Hardware device with Atmel chip and firmware
* C language system programming for Unix
* Device driver in Linux
* Linux kernel: page allocation
* Linux kernel: block device driver and md module

I'm inspired by [google-interview-university](https://github.com/jwasham/google-interview-university). I'd like to share my experience and show a kind of roadmap to be low-level programmer because I found that the low-level programmer is getting rare. And many students and beginners asked me how I could be low-level programmer and Linux kernel engineer.
