I think for long time, new C language programmer is getting rare.
As I'm solving the Eudyptula Challenge, an idea came to me that similar challenge is necessary for C language.

I'm not sure what tasks are suitable and how mant tasks are necessary..actually I have no plan yet.
But I'll write some tasks from printing "hello-world" to making a class with a function pointer.
If you have an idea, please send me pull-request.
